//! Cache maintenance operations
//!
//! These functions were adapted from the cortex-m (0.7.1) crate.
//! cortex-m only lets you access these functions when you have
//! the SCB in cortex_m::Peripherals collection. But, we neither want
//! to steal the peripheral(s), nor own them. So, we're duplicating
//! the routines that we need, and making sure that we're using
//! them safely.
//!
//! cortex-m crate available at <https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m>.
//!
//! See <https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/304>, and also #239.
//!
//! <https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/320> indicates that this might
//! be available in a near-future cortex-m crate.

/// Cleans and invalidates D-cache by address.
///
/// * `addr`: The address to clean and invalidate.
/// * `size`: The number of bytes to clean and invalidate.
///
/// Cleans and invalidates D-cache starting from the first cache line containing `addr`,
/// finishing once at least `size` bytes have been cleaned and invalidated.
///
/// It is recommended that `addr` is aligned to the cache line size and `size` is a multiple of
/// the cache line size, otherwise surrounding data will also be cleaned.
///
/// Cleaning and invalidating causes data in the D-cache to be written back to main memory,
/// and then marks that data in the D-cache as invalid, causing future reads to first fetch
/// from main memory.
///
/// # Architecture gate
///
/// On non-ARM targets (e.g. x86_64 in host unit tests) this function is a documented
/// no-op: there is no Cortex-M CBP register and no `dsb`/`isb` assembly available, and
/// cache maintenance is meaningless when running on the host. `cfg(target_arch = "arm")`
/// is the correct axis here (not `cfg(test)`) because it also covers `--doc` builds and
/// dependent-crate test builds that compile for the host.
