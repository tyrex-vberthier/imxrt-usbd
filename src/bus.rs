/// The `BusAdapter` adapts the USB peripheral instances, and exposes a `UsbBus` implementation.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// The driver assumes that you've prepared all USB clocks (CCM clock gates, CCM analog PLLs).
///
/// Before polling for USB class traffic, you must call [`configure()`](BusAdapter::configure())
/// *after* your device has been configured. This can be accomplished by polling the USB
/// device and checking its state until it's been configured. Once configured, use `UsbDevice::bus()`
/// to access the i.MX RT `BusAdapter`, and call `configure()`. You should only do this once.
/// After that, you may poll for class traffic.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example shows you how to create a `BusAdapter`, build a simple USB device, and
/// prepare the device for class traffic.
///
/// Note that this example does not demonstrate USB class allocation or polling. See
/// your USB class' documentation for details. This example also skips the clock initialization.

/// just want to use the driver, you can skip this section.
///
/// ## Packets and transfers
///
/// All i.MX RT USB drivers manage queue heads (QH), and transfer
/// descriptors (TD). For the driver, each (QH) is assigned
/// only one (TD) to perform I/O. We then assume each TD describes a single
/// packet. This is simple to implement, but it means that the
/// driver can only have one packet in flight per endpoint. You're expected
/// to quickly respond to `poll()` outputs, and schedule the next transfer
/// in the time required for devices. This becomes more important as you
/// increase driver speeds.
///
/// The hardware can zero-length terminate (ZLT) packets as needed if you
/// call [`enable_zlt`](BusAdapter::enable_zlt). By default, this feature is
/// off, because most `usb-device` classes / devices take care to send zero-length
/// packets, and enabling this feature could interfere with the class / device
/// behaviors.

/// This API provides a zero-copy, multi-transfer-in-flight path for bulk and
/// interrupt endpoints alongside the existing `UsbBus` single-packet path.
///
/// ## Retire law (EHCI)
///
/// A dTD is owned by the USB controller from the moment it is primed until the
/// ACTIVE bit clears. **No field of the dTD — and no byte of the associated DMA
/// buffer — may be read or written by software while ACTIVE is set.** Violating
/// this rule produces silent data corruption. `poll_transfer` / `poll_transfer`
/// enforce the retire law: they inspect ACTIVE before returning bytes.
///
/// ## Short-packet contract (OUT endpoints)
///
/// A short packet (fewer bytes than the TD announced) retires the current dTD
/// immediately and leaves any subsequent linked dTDs in the hardware queue. For
/// `submit_read`, callers should size OUT transfers to the announced data length
/// (e.g. a bulk CBW is exactly 31 bytes). Misbehaving hosts are recovered via
/// `bus_reset` / `UsbBus::reset`.
///
/// ## Lazy vs. eager OUT priming
///
/// Depth-1 OUT endpoints (the default) never have a staging transfer primed
/// unless the class explicitly calls `UsbBus::read`. This is the *lazy* rule:
/// it prevents the controller from swallowing a packet into a staging buffer
/// while a zero-copy data-phase transfer is active.
///
/// Endpoints configured with `set_packet_queue_depth(ep, N > 1)` are *eager*:
/// up to N staging transfers are kept primed at all times (CDC receive path).
///
/// ## Memory safety note
///
/// `submit_write` and `submit_read` accept raw slices and pass them to the DMA
/// engine. The controller writes/reads the memory asynchronously after the call
/// returns. Callers must guarantee that the slice remains valid and unmodified
/// until `poll_transfer` retires the record. Whether these methods should be
/// `unsafe fn` is an open question for upstream review; they are currently `safe`
/// because `BusAdapter` is `no_std`-firmware-only and the aliasing contract is
/// documented here.
